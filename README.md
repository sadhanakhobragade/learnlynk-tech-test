# LearnLynk Technical Test – Candidate Submission

This repository contains my implementation of the LearnLynk Backend Development Technical Assignment.

The project includes:

- PostgreSQL schema for `leads`, `applications`, and `tasks`
- RLS (Row Level Security) configuration for secure multi-tenant access
- Edge Function for server-side task creation
- A Next.js dashboard page showing tasks due today and allowing task completion
- Supporting documentation, examples, and testing helpers

This submission follows the exact folder structure and instructions provided in the assessment repository.

For detailed explanation, run instructions, assumptions, and testing guidance, see:

👉 **`README_SUPPLEMENT.md`**  
👉 **`NOTES.md`**

The project is designed for clarity, correctness, and maintainability while keeping the implementation aligned with MVP requirements.
